============ REACT ============
    React is simply just a JavaScript Library that is used to create websites.
React allows us to easily create single page apps (SPA's for short). 
And by a single page i mean the server only needs to send a single HTML page to the browser for the website to run fully, then React takes over and manages the whole website in the browser including any kind of website data or user interactivity such as click events and even routing from page to page.
 * Note: Users can still navigate from one route to the other but this routes are not sent to
        the user from the server but instead React changes the content of the webpages depending on the route of the url link that was clicked. This happens within a speedy amount of time which makes create webpages or website more efficient and faster. This process is totally in contrast with how creating a website with different webpages generally works, whereby each new webpage is sent to the browser directly 
        from the server immediately a user makes a request to another route.

Using the Creat-react-app tool to create our first react project.
- First we navigate into the directory we want to create our app.
- The we type in `npx create-react-app` on our command line
